# jQuery Loading Spinner

### 3 examples which demonstrate how you can use loading spinner with jQuery when doing a request from the server.

jQuery isn't dead although the big trio Angular, Vue, React took over the front-end development. jQuery is still used in many projects and it's still a good choice for small projects or even big projects if the project works well, is well maintained and the performance isn't affected.

My vue (pun intended) on whether to choose between jQuery vs Vue / React / Angular. Use whatever you think makes most sense for your app in the long run. For example, you may not want to choose React or Angular just for the sake of it or because it's "cool" to use them because they're mainstream. Use Vue / React / Angular if it is really necessary and will benefit your app. Vue is a good choice in most cases. Anyway just my 2 cents. Up to you.
